# Adv_ML_NLP
The goal of the project is to provide a data text synthesis of a massive corpora of scientific articles
about natural language processing.
This amount of data is not really big, just 44Mo, but is big enough to be too complicated to be
processed by hand.
The first part of the project is unsupervised. Analysis is provided on the folder : ProjetFinal_Louis_REMY_Branavan_SUBRAMANIAM.
